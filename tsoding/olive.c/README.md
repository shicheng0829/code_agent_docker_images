# Olive.c Development Environment

This repository contains a Docker-based development environment for [Olive.c](https://github.com/tsoding/olive.c), a simple graphics library that renders everything into memory pixel by pixel.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system

## Usage

### Building and Running Tests

To build the Docker image and run the tests, simply execute:

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build the Docker image with all necessary dependencies
2. Compile the Olive.c library and test suite
3. Run all tests and display the results

### Manual Docker Usage

If you prefer to use Docker manually, you can:

1. Build the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t olive-c-dev .
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   docker run olive-c-dev
   ```

### Interactive Development

To get an interactive shell in the Docker container for development:

```bash
docker run -it olive-c-dev /bin/bash
```

Inside the container, you'll find:
- The Olive.c source code in `/app`
- The compiled test suite at `/app/build/test`
- All necessary build tools and dependencies

## What's Included

The Docker image includes:
- Ubuntu 20.04 base system
- Clang compiler
- Build essentials
- libpng development libraries
- Python 3
- All dependencies needed to build and test Olive.c

The build process:
1. Compiles the `nob` build tool
2. Generates necessary assets from PNG and OBJ files
3. Builds the test suite with memory sanitization enabled
4. Runs all tests to verify the library functionality

## Project Structure

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the development environment
- `run-tests.sh`: Convenience script to build and test
- `olive.c`: The main library source
- `test.c`: Test suite for the library
- `nob.c`: Build system
- `assets/`: Source assets (PNG images, 3D models)
- `build/`: Compiled output (generated by the build process)

## Contributing

This environment is designed to make it easy to contribute to Olive.c:
1. Make your changes to the source code
2. Run `./run-tests.sh` to verify everything still works
3. Submit a pull request to the main Olive.c repository
