# Olive.c Docker Development Environment - Summary

This project provides a complete Docker-based development environment for the Olive.c graphics library.

## Files Created

1. **Dockerfile**: Defines the Ubuntu-based development environment with all necessary dependencies:
   - Ubuntu 20.04 base
   - Clang compiler
   - Build essentials
   - libpng development libraries
   - Python 3

2. **run-tests.sh**: A convenience script that:
   - Builds the Docker image
   - Runs all tests
   - Reports results

3. **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation on how to use the development environment

## Features

- **Self-contained**: All dependencies are included in the Docker image
- **Reproducible**: Anyone with Docker can reproduce the exact same environment
- **Easy testing**: One command to build and test the entire library
- **Memory sanitization**: Tests are built with memory sanitization for better bug detection
- **Asset generation**: Automatically converts PNG and OBJ files to C code during build

## Usage

Simply run:
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

This will:
1. Build the Docker image with all dependencies
2. Compile the Olive.c library and test suite
3. Run all tests and display results

## Test Results

All tests are currently passing:
- Basic drawing operations (rectangles, circles, lines, triangles)
- Advanced features (alpha blending, text rendering, sprites)
- Edge cases (empty rectangles, null sprites, out-of-bounds operations)
- Complex operations (barycentric coordinates, bilinear interpolation)

## Benefits

- No need to install dependencies on the host system
- Consistent environment across different machines
- Easy to reproduce build issues
- Simple contribution workflow for Olive.c
