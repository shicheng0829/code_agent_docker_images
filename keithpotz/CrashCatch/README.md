CrashCatch is a lightweight, single-header C++ crash-reporting library for generating `.dmp` and `.txt` crash logs — complete with stack traces, diagnostics, optional cleanup hooks, and user dialogs.

---

## 🎯 Overview

CrashCatch provides simple and powerful crash diagnostics for C++ applications on **Windows and Linux**, with macOS support planned. Whether you're building GUI apps, system tools, or CLI utilities, CrashCatch helps you catch and log critical failures with minimal setup.

As of **v1.2**, CrashCatch supports rich crash context capture and includes optional post-crash upload integration.

## 🔧 Installation
CrashCatch is 100% header-only.

To integrate:

1. Copy `include/CrashCatch.hpp` into your project
2. Add `#include "CrashCatch.hpp"` in your code
3. (Optional) Use `CrashCatch::enable()` or the `CRASHCATCH_AUTO_INIT` macro
4. For Linux inlcude `-ldl` or `-rdynamic` for deeper Linux symbole resolution if desired

> ✅ No build steps.  
> ❌ No `.lib`, `.dll`, or `.so`.  
> 🔒 Just one `.hpp` file, ready to use.

Copy `CrashCatch.hpp` into your project and include it:

```cpp
#include "CrashCatch.hpp"

## QuickStart
### Zero Config (Auto-init)
```cpp
#define CRASHCATCH_AUTO_INIT
#include "CrashCatch.hpp"

int main(){
    int* ptr = nullptr;
    *ptr = 42; // simulated crash
}
```
### One-Liner Initialization
```cpp
#include "CrashCatch.hpp"
int main(){
    CrashCatch::enable(); //Initalizes with default config

    int* ptr = nullptr;
    *ptr = 42; // simulated crash
}
```
### Full Configuration
```cpp
#include "CrashCatch.hpp"

int main(){
    CrashCatch::Config config:
    config.appVersion = "1.0.0";
    config.buildConfig = "Release";
    config.additionalNotes = "This is a test build.";
    config.onCrash = []{
        std::cout << "Cleaning up before crash...\n"/
    };
    config.showCrashDialog = true;

    CrashCatch::initalize(config);

    int* ptr = nullptr;
    *ptr = 42; // simulated crash
}
```

## 📦 CMake Integration

You can install CrashCatch with:

```bash
cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install
cmake --build build --target install
find_package(CrashCatch REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE CrashCatch::CrashCatch)
```
---
---

## 📄 Crash Output

When a crash occurs, CrashCatch generates the following files in the `./crash_dumps/` directory:

- `crash_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.dmp` — Binary MiniDump (viewable in tools like WinDbg)
- `crash_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt` — Human-readable crash summary

### 📋 Example `.txt` Includes:

```text
Crash Report (Windows)

```
```text
Crash Report (Linux)
============
Timestamp: 2025-04-04_15-42-18

### The .txt files contains:
- **Timestamp**: The time the crash occurred.
- **Dump File**: The path to the generated MiniDump file.
- **Exception Code**: The exception code that caused the crash.
- **Thread ID**: The ID of the thread that crashed.
- **Stack Trace**: A list of function calls leading up to the crash.
- **Environment Info**: Additional information about the environment in which the crash occurred.
- **Architecture (x86/x64)**: The architecture of the system where the crash occurred.
- **Executable**: The path to the executable that crashed.

## Crash Context API
CrashCatch provides detailed crash metadata via `CrashContext`:
```cpp
struct CrashContext{
  std::string dumpFilePath;
  std::string logFilePath;
  std::string timestamp;
  int singalOrCode;
};
```
You can use both in `onCrash` and `onCrashUpload`
