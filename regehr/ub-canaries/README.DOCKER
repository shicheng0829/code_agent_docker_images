# UB Canaries Development Environment

This Dockerfile sets up a complete development environment for working with the UB Canaries project.

## Features

- Ubuntu 20.04 base image
- GCC and Clang compilers
- Perl interpreter (required for running tests)
- GDB debugger and Valgrind memory analyzer
- Vim and Nano text editors
- Git version control

## Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t ub-canaries-dev .
```

## Running Tests

### Run all tests:
```bash
docker run --rm ub-canaries-dev
```

### Run a specific test:
```bash
docker run --rm ub-canaries-dev /usr/local/bin/run-test signed-integer-overflow
```

### Interactive development:
```bash
docker run --rm -it ub-canaries-dev bash
```

Inside the container, you can:
- Edit files with `vim` or `nano`
- Run tests with `./run-canaries`
- Debug programs with `gdb`
- Analyze memory usage with `valgrind`
- Use `run-test <test-name>` to run individual tests

## Modifying Tests

To modify and test your changes:
1. Start an interactive container: `docker run --rm -it ub-canaries-dev bash`
2. Make changes to the C files
3. Run specific tests to see the results
4. Exit the container when done

Note that changes inside the container are not persistent. To make permanent changes, modify the files on your host system and rebuild the Docker image.
